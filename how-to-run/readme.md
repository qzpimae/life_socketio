concise steps to run this project on your own. if you have never used git or nodejs, this may be a bit difficult, but that's how you learn!! 

  - install nodejs and git if you havent already
  - clone this repo to your computer [git clone https://github.com/qzpimae/life_socketio.git]
  - run npm install in the terminal while located in the repo directory
  - run [npm start] by default the server will run on port 3333 
  - navigate to the webpage localhost:3333 on the server device, or find the local network ip for the server device, then nagivate on your other device [ip address]:3333
  - the home/root page is the controller page that has a button to "seed" life into the simulation, /project is best for visuals, you can also use Space to seed while on this page


if you'd like to play around with another version, i create this version as a "happy accident" Harry enjoyed the glitch and coined it as being "radionic"
